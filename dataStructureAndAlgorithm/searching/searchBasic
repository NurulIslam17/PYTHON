        Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search,
        a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and
        if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search
        continues till the end of the data collection

> Binary Search:

        < Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n).
        < This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer.
        < For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.
